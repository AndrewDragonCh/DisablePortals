# Disable Portals

A basic plugin to disable portals. Includes a command to toggle both end and nether portals. This plugin is mainly for me to learn Java and also basic CI/CD and the likes

## Game Rule

Minecraft 1.21.9 removed the server property `allow-nether` in favor of the new game rule `allowEnteringNetherUsingPortals` - [source](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-21-9#:~:text=Removed%20server%20property%20allow%2Dnether%20in%20favor%20of%20the%20new%20game%20rule%20allowEnteringNetherUsingPortals)
With that, the `togglenetherportals` command will be depricated in favor of the new game rule.
